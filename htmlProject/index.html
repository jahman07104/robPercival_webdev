            Jamaica, island country of the West Indies. It is the third largest
            island in the Caribbean Sea, after Cuba and Hispaniola. Jamaica is
            about 146 miles (235 km) long and varies from 22 to 51 miles (35 to
            82 km) wide. It is situated some 100 miles (160 km) west of Haiti,
            90 miles (150 km) south of Cuba, and 390 miles (630 km) northeast of
            the nearest point on the mainland, Cape Gracias a Dios, on the
            Caribbean coast of Central America. The national capital is
            Kingston.

            Christopher Columbus, who first sighted the island in 1494, called
            it Santiago, but the original indigenous name of Jamaica, or
            Xaymaca, has persisted. Columbus considered it to be “the fairest
            isle that eyes have beheld,” and many travelers still regard it as
            one of the most beautiful islands in the Caribbean. The island’s
            various Spanish, French, and English place-names are remnants of its
            colonial history. The great majority of its people are of African
            ancestry, the descendants of slaves brought by European colonists.
            Jamaica became independent from the United Kingdom in 1962 but
            remains a member of the Commonwealth.

          <h3>Land</h3>
          <p>
            Interior mountains and plateaus cover much of Jamaica’s length, and
            nearly half of the island’s surface is more than 1,000 feet (300
            metres) above sea level. The most rugged topography and highest
            elevations are in the east, where the Blue Mountains rise to 7,402
            feet (2,256 metres) at Blue Mountain Peak, the island’s highest
            point. Karst (limestone) landscapes with ridges, depressions, and
            sinkholes (“cockpits”) characterize the hills and plateaus of the
            John Crow Mountains, the Dry Harbour Mountains, and Cockpit Country,
            a region covering 500 square miles (1,300 square km) in western
            Jamaica. The Don Figuerero, Santa Cruz, and May Day mountains are
            major landforms in the southwest. Coastal plains largely encircle
            the island, and the largest alluvial plains are located in the
            south.
